      ` It took a long time for me to get into front end development because
	  I was still learning how to code. Before I got into programming, I
	  was primarily interested in learning 3D design with Blender.
	  However, you are all aware that 3D design softwares consume so many
	  resources in the machine that you could literally use it as a heater
	  in your room.`,
      `Learning 'Blender' was a time-consuming and painful task. If you
	  have low-end PCs, you literally have to wait 2 - 3 minutes to render
	  a single frame.`,
      `Blender couldn't run smoothly on complex scenes on low-end PCs. So I
	  dumped Blender and began learning mobile app development. For
	  creating cross-platform apps, I used Flutter, a Google UI toolkit.
	  Days passed, and I was pleased with the Flutter but not completely
	  satisfied. As a result, I began learning React.`,
      `I was very pleased with the react after writing some react codes.
	  Following my introduction to React, I began studying NextJS (a React
	  framework) for Static Site Generation (SSG), Server Side Rendering
	  (SSR), and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).`,
      `Don't know about SSG, SSR and ISR?`,
